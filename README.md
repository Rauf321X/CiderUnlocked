# CiderUnlocked
A repository dedicated to publishing Cider 1.x open-source builds in a more accessible way, so that you don't have to purchase originally open-source builds of Cider from Cider Collective.

### Description:

As Cider Collective has you purchase builds of Cider from the Microsoft Store rather than through GitHub releases that are completely free and open-source, CiderUnlocked
removes the barriers by publishing Cider software in a repository where no licenses are present. All Cider releases are tailored to your specific OS when chosen. 
Versions of Cider published on CiderUnlocked are completely free and open-sourced by Cider Collective. For official GitHub entities of Cider Collective, go to @ciderapp.

We are not in any way affiliated with Cider Collective. Our purpose is to make open-source software readily made available by Cider Collective acccessible. Please
visit Cider Collective and comply with their terms before acquiring any software from CiderUnlocked. We are not responsible for any use of Cider's services when installed, and use of Cider Connect, Apple Music, and Cider's services, and the Cider Collective Discord server is not managed by CiderUnlocked. 

We aim to publish Cider-related software only when it's open-sourced. When servicing or contacting Cider Collective for support, do not mention CiderUnlocked. All software adheres to Cider Collective's knowledge base, and you should be good to go without mentioning us. We do not modify Cider software unless necessary to pack builds of Cider. All installation files are not modified by CiderUnlocked.

### Updates:

We're currently working on packing Cider 2.x builds when they're open-sourced. Currently, Cider Collective only allows Cider (EA) or 2.x builds to be acquired through purchase or support. If you'd like to get your hands on these new versions of Cider, please visit Cider Collective's resources or wait for us to pack builds of 2.x or EA. Otherwise, visit our collection of Cider 1.x open-source builds.

CiderUnlocked provides versions of AME (Apple Music Electron), but you'll have to ask the owner of CiderUnlocked to provide it to you. We may provide versions of AME later, but we're currently oriented towards Cider or AME upon request.

Thanks for visiting us!
